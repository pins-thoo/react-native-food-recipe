# FoodieRecipe

## To rename the app to your desired name (Cannot be UNDONE!)
1. Remove the android & ios folder
2. Open app.json and change the following to new app name
```
{
  "name": "FoodieRecipe",
  "displayName": "FoodieRecipe"
}
```
3. At FoodieRecipe folder, run the following command
```
react-native eject
```
4. It will regenerate new android & ios folder with corresponding name + app identifier (eg. com.FoodieRecipe)
5. Run the following command (important! to link the related packages to native platform)
```
react-native link
```

### For Android (Additional Setup only if rename the app)
- Copy the following to android/app/build.gradle (with /app).
- Put it after `apply plugin: "com.android.application"`
- This is to cater for different environments
```
project.ext.envConfigFiles = [
    debug: "environments/.env.development",
    release: "environments/.env.production",
]

apply from: project(':react-native-config').projectDir.getPath() + "/dotenv.gradle"
```

- Open 'android/app/build.gradle'
- Change all `compile` to `implementation` (compile is deprecated :p)
```
dependencies {
    implementation project(':react-native-gesture-handler')
    implementation project(':react-native-vector-icons')
    implementation project(':react-native-config')
    implementation fileTree(dir: "libs", include: ["*.jar"])
    implementation "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}"
    implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:+"  // From node_modules
}
```

### For iOS (Additional Setup only if rename the app)
- Open [app-name].xcodeproj under ios/ folder
- Click on the Edit Scheme
- Build > Pre-Action > Add New Run Script Action
- Copy the following into the text area
```
echo "./environments/.env.development" > /tmp/envfile
```
- Then press Duplicate Scheme
- Rename the new scheme name to 'App Name (Production)'
- Edit Scheme for the production
- Build > Pre-Action > Add New Run Script Action
- Press Manage Schemes > Tick "Shared" for your new scheme (else it will be ignored by Git)
```
echo "./environments/.env.production" > /tmp/envfile
```
- Yo, you are good to go !
